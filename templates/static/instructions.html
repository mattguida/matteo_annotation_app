  <h2>Understanding the Influence of News Framing on Readers</h2>
  <p>Hi there! Thanks for agreeing to participate in this annotation task.</p>
  <p>In this project, we're investigating the different formulations of news in terms of frames.</p>
  <button onclick="showBlock(2)">Continue</button>
</div>

<div id="block2" class="instructions-block" style="display:none;">
  <h2>What Are Frames?</h2>
  <p>Frames are the perspectives or angles through which information is presented in media. They highlight certain aspects of an issue while downplaying others, influencing how audiences understand and respond to news.</p>
  <p>Think of frames as different "lenses" that focus attention on specific elements of a story while leaving others in the background.</p>
  <p>For example, same-sex marriage could be framed as a "human rights issue" emphasizing equality, or as a "religious/moral issue" emphasizing traditional values.</p>
  <p>Frames answer the question: <em>"How is the issue at hand being presented?"</em></p>
  <button onclick="showBlock(1)">Go Back</button>
  <button onclick="showBlock(3)">Continue</button>
</div>

<div id="block3" class="instructions-block" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Your Task</h2>
  <p>Your task is to identify which frames are used in short snippets of text from various sources. This helps us understand how different issues are presented and framed in different contexts.</p>
  <button onclick="showBlock(2)">Go Back</button>
  <button onclick="showBlock(4)">Continue</button>
</div>

<div id="block4" class="instructions-block" style="display:none;">
  <h2>How the Annotation Works</h2>
  <p>You will see one text at a time. Please read each text carefully and choose the frame that best represents how the information is being conveyed by clicking on the corresponding label (colourful boxes).</p>
  <p>If you think more than one frame applies, please select all that you believe are relevant.</p>
  <p>If none of the provided categories apply, please select the label "No Frame".</p>
  <p>The following page includes the framing labels, along with their definitions and an example for each.</p>
  <p>Once you'll start annotating, you can click on the "Instructions" blue button on the right side of the page at any time to retrieve this list.</p>

<!-- Previously block 2: Framing Categories -->
<div id="block5" class="instructions-block" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Framing Categories</h2>
    <p><strong>Economic</strong><br>
    Description: The costs, benefits, or monetary/financial implications of the issue (to an individual, family, community, or to the economy as a whole).<br>
    Example: Legalizing same-sex marriage would boost state economies through increased spending on weddings and tourism.</p>

    <p><strong>Morality</strong><br>
    Description: Any perspective—or policy objective or action (including proposed action)—that is compelled by religious doctrine or interpretation, duty, honor, righteousness or any other sense of ethics or social responsibility.<br>
    Example: Same-sex marriage is morally wrong and goes against the teachings of our faith.</p>

    <p><strong>Fairness and Equality</strong><br>
    Description: Equality or inequality with which laws, punishment, rewards, and resources are applied or distributed among individuals or groups. Also the balance between the rights or interests of one individual or group compared to another individual or group.<br>
    Example: Denying same-sex couples the right to marry is a clear violation of equal protection under the law.</p>

    <p><strong>Legality and Crime</strong><br>
    Description: The constraints imposed on or freedoms granted to individuals, government, and corporations via laws, the Constitution, and judicial interpretation. Includes enforcement of laws, breaking laws, crime rates, sentencing, punishment, and legal consequences. Covers both the authority to regulate and the actual application/violation of rules.<br>
    Example: The Supreme Court ruled that bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional and violate civil liberties.</p>

    <p><strong>Health and Safety</strong><br>
    Description: Healthcare access and effectiveness, illness, disease, sanitation, obesity, mental health effects, prevention of or perpetuation of gun violence, infrastructure and building safety.<br>
    Example: Allowing same-sex marriage is an endorsement of unsafe sexual practices and will contribute to the spread of disease.</p>

    <p><strong>Cultural Identity</strong><br>
    Description: The social norms, trends, values and customs constituting culture(s).<br>
    Example: Same-sex marriage threatens the traditional concept of family that our culture has upheld for generations.</p>

    <p><strong>Public Opinion</strong><br>
    Description: References to general social attitudes, polling and demographic information, as well as implied or actual consequences of diverging from or "getting ahead of" public opinion or polls.<br>
    Example: A recent poll shows that 65% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 30% a decade ago.</p>

    <p><strong>Security and Defense</strong><br>
    Description: Concerns related to safety, protection from threats or of one's person, national security, border security, and measures taken to ensure stability and defense.<br>
    Example: Same-sex marriage could undermine traditional social structures and thus contribute to community stability and security.</p>

    <p><strong>Political and Policies</strong><br>
    Description: Any political considerations and discourse surrounding an issue, as well as policies including partisan dynamics, lobbyist involvement, bipartisan efforts, political maneuvering, vote trading, and legislative processes.<br>
    Example: The governor vetoed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, citing pressure from conservative lawmakers.</p>

    <p><strong>None</strong><br>
    Description: If the sentence is not framed in any of the proposed labels above, please select this label.<br>

<!-- New Practice Block -->
<div id="block6" class="instructions-block" style="display:none;">
  <h2>Practice Phase</h2>
  <p>Before starting the actual annotation task, we'll practice together with three examples.</p>
  <p>During the practice phase:</p>
  <p>• You will be shown <strong>one sentence at a time</strong></p>
  <p>• You should <strong>select the appropriate frame label(s)</strong> by clicking on the colored boxes</p>
  <p>• After you make your selection, the <strong>correct answer will appear underneath with an explanation</strong>.</p>
  <p> Take your time to read each sentence carefully and consider which perspective or angle is being emphasized.</p>
